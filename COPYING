Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining

    the "Software" is free to use,
    copy, modify, merge, publish, and distribute the Software,
    subject to the following conditions:

1. This License applies to the original source code and assets created by the Author,
    together with any modifications, derivative works, or redistributions thereof,
    provided such works include attribution and comply with the conditions of this License.
    
2. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included
   in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
3. The person obtaining the Software copy and redistributing it as "endorsed/supported by (The Author/Users)"
    is prohibited unless the Software owner has explicitly waived the rights.

4. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE SOFTWARE, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING, THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
   PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
   INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
   FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
   SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

5. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
    reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program,
    unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

6. if local law or other obligations prevent you from fully complying with NPPL's terms,
    you may distribute the Software only under the minimal conditions and modifications that such law allows,
    provided that the distribution does not remove or weaken the attribution, endorsement restriction,
    or disclaimer of warranty contained in this License.

7. You may distribute or relicense the Software under another
    open-source license, provided that such license:
    (a) requires the Software and its modifications to remain open-source under reciprocal terms,
    (b) preserves the attribution and disclaimer of warranty contained in this License, and
    (c) does not impose additional restrictions on the user's exercise of the rights granted by this License.
